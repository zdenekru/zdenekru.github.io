# Creating My Personal Website with Jekyll

Today, I started building my very own personal website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I chose Jekyll because it’s simple, flexible, and well supported by GitHub Pages, which makes hosting easy and free.

## Choosing a Minimalistic Theme

I wanted a clean, minimalistic design that focuses on content rather than flashy visuals. After browsing through several themes, I settled on a lightweight layout that’s easy to customize and maintain. Minimalism helps keep the site fast and accessible.

## Adding My Tech Stack and Pictures

One of the first content pages I created lists my tech stack — the tools and technologies I use regularly. I included different categories like programming languages, version control, 3D design tools, and more.

I also experimented with adding pictures, like logos of the technologies I use, but decided to keep things simple for now to ensure faster loading and easier maintenance.

## Working with GitHub Manually

Instead of forking an existing Jekyll theme repo, I set up the site manually from scratch. This approach took more time, but it helped me learn the ins and outs of how Jekyll works — from configuring `_config.yml` to organizing my layouts, pages, and assets.

## Plans for the Future

Looking ahead, I want to make the site bilingual — supporting both English and Czech. This will make the content accessible to a wider audience and also help me practice managing multilingual content in Jekyll.

I’m excited to continue improving the site with new features, better styling, and more useful content.
