# 👋 About Me

I'm an engineer and maker who enjoys combining electronics, programming, and automation. I focus on building real-world solutions — from smart home setups to industrial control systems — and I like tailoring designs to match specific needs, whether it's for a personal project or a business.

I believe in learning by doing, so I try to avoid shortcuts: this website was built from the ground up using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, without forking a theme repo — just to better understand the process.

## ⚙️ What I Work On

### 🧾 Electrical Design

I work across different areas of electrical design:

- **🏭 Industrial Automation**  
  PLCs (Unipi, WAGO), wiring, panel design, software (Codesys, Mervis)

- **🧠 Custom Electronics for Specific Needs**  
  Whether it's a prototype for a startup or a tool for a hobbyist, I enjoy designing and building hardware tailored to real use cases

- **🏠 Home Automation**  
  ESP32/STM32-based sensor networks, dashboards, smart control systems, and integration with platforms like MQTT or Grafana

### 💻 Embedded & Programming

- Programming in **Python** and **C++**
- Using microcontrollers like **ESP32**, **STM32**, and **ATMega328P**
- PCB and hardware design in **KiCAD**, **CircuitMaker**
- Simulation with **LTSpice**
- Prototyping and enclosure design in **Fusion 360**, **FreeCAD**

## 🧱 About This Site

This site is a place to document and share my work. I chose a minimalist design and built it manually with Jekyll to stay flexible and learn something along the way. It includes:

- My [tech stack](/stack/)
- My [projects](/projects/) page (both finished and in development)
- Plans to offer the site in **English and Czech**
