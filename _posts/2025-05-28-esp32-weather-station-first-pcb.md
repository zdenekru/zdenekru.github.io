After a bit of breadboard chaos and cable spaghetti, it was time to move to something more permanent. Meet **Rev0** — the first PCB for the ESP32 Weather Station project.

## 🛠️ Specs & Design Philosophy

- Designed in **KiCAD**
- Ordered from [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com)
- Dimensions: **100mm × 100mm** — the largest possible for their standard pricing
  - ✅ Leaves space for **wide traces**, labels, and comfort
  - ✅ No surcharge for going to full 100×100
- Color: **Black**
  - Because... elegance 😎
- All **unused GPIOs** are **broken out to pin headers** for future expandability
- Includes a **QR code** linking directly to the GitHub repo:  
  [ESP32-Mark0 GitHub](https://github.com/zdenekru/ESP32-Mark0)
  - ⚠️ Small issue: The QR code is technically in the *pad layer* due to a layering problem during export. It should be in the *silkscreen* layer.

## 🧠 Breadboard Lessons → PCB Decisions

In the previous post ([Love/Hate with Breadboards](/posts/esp32-weather-station-mark0-breadboard-journey/)), I talked about how fragile breadboarding can be.

So for this board:

- I chose **precision pin sockets** to ensure the ESP32 DevKit board sits firmly in place
- Since **Neven** (the ESP32 board manufacturer) doesn’t publish a proper footprint, I manually added **two rows of 15-pin female headers** in the schematic

## 📐 Schematic

Here’s the schematic for **Rev0**:

## 🚀 Next Steps

Waiting for the PCBs to arrive! Once they’re here, I’ll do assembly, first boot, and then finally power it up without worry of faulty breadboards' jumper wires.

Stay tuned for a build log once Rev0 is in hand!
