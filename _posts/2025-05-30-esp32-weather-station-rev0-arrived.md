# ðŸ“¦ ESP32 Weather Station â€“ PCBs Rev0 Arrived and, Well, It's No Bueno

Great news â€” the **Rev0 PCBs** for the ESP32 Weather Station project have arrived from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com), and the quality is absolutely stunning!

ðŸ’¸ **The cost?** Just **4 Euros for 5 pieces** â€” shipping included. Honestly, Iâ€™m still amazed by what you can get for that price.

Excited by how they turned out, I immediately began soldering. The **pre-soldered pad finish** made it a joy to work with â€” everything flowed smoothly, and the **precision pin sockets** went in without trouble.

But then... I noticed something.

Yeah. Thatâ€™s a bit of a **collision** between the **NodeMCU board** and the **eInk display**. They physically *donâ€™t* fit well together on the current layout. A rookie mistake â€” but thatâ€™s what Rev0 is for: learning.

So, I fired up **KiCAD** again, reworked the layout, and placed an order for **Rev1**. This time in **white**, still elegant â€” but now visually distinguishable from the black Rev0 boards.

## ðŸ§  Visual Recap from KiCAD

Hereâ€™s a look at the Rev0 board design â€” **top layer**, **bottom layer**, and **3D render**, all side by side:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  <img src="/assets/img/esp32-mark0/rev1-bottom.png" alt="Bottom Layer" width="32%" />
  <img src="/assets/img/esp32-mark0/rev1-3d-view.png" alt="3D View" width="32%" />
</div>

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Mistakes were made. **Lessons were learned**.  
Now Iâ€™m waiting on Rev1 â€” and I canâ€™t wait to share how that one turns out.

Stay tuned!
