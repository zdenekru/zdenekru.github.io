**Mark0 Rev1 Has Landed 🚀** The **Rev1** version of my Mark0 board has just arrived from JLCPCB — and once again, I'm genuinely surprised by the quality and speed. Seriously, **they're not paying me**, this is just me being impressed every single time.

### White is the New Black

For Rev1, I chose a **white PCB solder mask** to visually distinguish it from Rev0. It also gives the board a cleaner look, and it's easier to spot traces and silkscreen.

### What Got Soldered

This time I soldered:
- **ESP32 Devkit**
- **DHT11 sensor**

What I didn't solder: the **eInk display** — because it was a bit pricey and I want to reuse it in other builds. Instead, I went with **precision sockets** to keep it hot-swappable.

### Improvements & Fixes

Functionally, it behaves the same as Rev0. The **main difference** is that now I can:
- **See the full eInk display**
- **Scan the QR code**, because it's finally in the **silkscreen layer** and **not covering any pads** (yes... lesson learned 😅)

### What's Next?

The very last thing I *might* do with this board is tweak the firmware a little, so it **stores the last 24h of sensor values** directly on my PC. But only if I feel like it — otherwise, this marks the **official wrap-up of Project Mark0**.

### 🔧 Lessons Learned

- Use **4-pin USB-C** if you just need power — don’t overcomplicate.
- Due to limits of API calls for free use move from every **3 minutes to 10 minutes**. To be sure.
- **THT connectors** are more solder-friendly.
- Keep the **WiFi/BLE antenna at the edge of the PCB** — don’t bury it.
- Next time, I’ll **3D print standoff legs** for the eInk and plan **mounting holes** directly into the PCB layout.

So… this is kinda it. Mark0 is done. On to **Mark1** I go.  
**Stay tuned!**
